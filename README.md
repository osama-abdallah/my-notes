## Introduction about me

*Hello im Osama Abdallah*, 26 years old Jordanian national aspiring to be a JS software developer.

### Summery for article titled “Good developer mindset in 15 minutes”

#### *it did not take 15 minutes :P.*

The key to being a good developer is to get out of your own way, be simple, understanding. I say this as the first things any good developer should follow is to **create code that is easy for him and helpful to others**, how to do that you might ask? *Just as simple as the code you should be writing*:

1. Make your stupide, dumb simple by being smart enough to understand the system and tools you are using.
2. Think about future maintenance, keeping it consistent goes along way and changes that will bring most value with the least effort are the ones worth doing and if you can get a machine to do it for you even better *“if its not broken don’t fix it”*.
3. Start small and grow, always try to decrease your code and test it and when you add a comment add it to explain *“why”* not what keep in mind to always *“check yourself before you wreck yourself”*.
4.To solve problems you should understand, plan and then divide usually reading will get you a long way as everything has a solution if you cant think of it no shame in asking for help, but finally don’t be a slave to modern tech. try and be your own master.
*This probably took 15 minutes to read ;)*
